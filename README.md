# Phat Contract Launch Campaign
This campaign will be focused on launching your own LensAPI Oracle to achieve the Starter and Master ranks. Follow the details to earn a new rank and claim your rewards!

## Hello, LensAPI Oracle!

Hello, LensAPI Oracle! is launched as Phat Contract lives on the Phala mainnet. The main purpose of this event is to provide an opportunity for people to learn about Phala Contract, and for developers to experience the power of its blueprint, which offers a "no-code experience" that can scale your ideas in minutes. 

During this process, teams and individuals can freely define and develop their own LensAPI Oracle, creating a personalized and tailored experience for your own social dApps.

Phala proposes a prize pool to encourage engagement, and this repository is for individual developers to submit their projects to win the rewards.
